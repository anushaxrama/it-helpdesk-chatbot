## 🎨 Demo Script for Interviews

### 1-Minute Demo

"I built an AI-powered IT helpdesk chatbot that automates technical support. Users can ask questions in natural language, and the system uses RAG with LangChain to search a knowledge base of 50+ IT solutions. 

For example, if someone asks 'My Zoom audio isn't working,' the bot retrieves relevant troubleshooting steps from the vector database and uses GPT-4 to generate a clear, contextual response. It maintains conversation history, so users can ask follow-up questions.

The system also detects when issues are too complex and automatically suggests escalation with a ticket creation form. I built the backend with FastAPI and Python, the frontend with React and TypeScript, and used ChromaDB for semantic search."

## 💼 Interview Talking Points

### For Technical Questions

**Q: How does the RAG system work?**
> "I load IT support documentation into ChromaDB as vector embeddings. When a user asks a question, I convert their query to an embedding and perform semantic search to find the top 3 most relevant solutions. These are passed as context to GPT-4, which generates a natural response grounded in actual IT knowledge, reducing hallucinations."

**Q: How do you handle conversation memory?**
> "I use LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory, which stores the chat history per conversation ID. This lets users ask follow-up questions like 'What if that doesn't work?' without repeating context. Each conversation is isolated, so multiple users can chat simultaneously."

**Q: What would you improve given more time?**
> "First, integrate with real ticketing systems like ServiceNow. Second, add user authentication and conversation history persistence. Third, implement analytics to track which issues are most common and measure resolution rates. Fourth, add support for screenshot uploads so users can show error messages."

### For Behavioral Questions

**Q: Describe a technical challenge you overcame.**
> "Getting accurate responses was initially difficult because the LLM would sometimes make up solutions. I solved this by implementing RAG - ensuring responses are always grounded in the actual knowledge base. I also tuned the prompt to explicitly tell the model to admit when it doesn't know something and suggest escalation."

**Q: How do you ensure good user experience?**
> "I focused on speed, clarity, and feedback. The UI shows typing indicators so users know the system is working. Responses are formatted with numbered steps for easy following. I added sources so users can verify information. And the escalation flow makes it easy to get human help when needed."
